Simulation of  Genealogies
========================================================

Ape and coalMCMC have functions that simulates genealogies under the coalescent model for specific demographic scenarios.

When you click the **Knit HTML** button a web page will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library("ape")
rcoal(5)
plot(rcoal(5))
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
plot(cars)
```

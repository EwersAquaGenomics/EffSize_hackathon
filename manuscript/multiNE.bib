abstract = {Analysis of linkage disequilibrium ({\^{}} r2=mean squared correlation of allele frequencies at different gene loci) provides a means of estimating effective population size (Ne) from a single sample, but this method has seen much less use than the temporal method (which requires at least two samples). It is shown that for realistic numbers of loci and alleles, the linkage disequilibrium method can provide precision comparable to that of the temporal method. However, computer simulations show that estimates of Ne based on {\^{}} r2 for unlinked, diallelic gene loci are sharply biased downwards ( {\^{}} Ne=N<0:1 in some cases) if sample size (S) is less than true Ne. The bias is shown to arise from inaccuracies in published formula for Eð{\^{}} r2Þ when S and/or Ne are small. Empirically derived modifications to Eð{\^{}} r2Þ for two mating systems (random mating and lifetime monogamy) effectively eliminate the bias (residual bias in {\^{}} Ne<5{\%} in most cases). The modified method also performs well in estimating Ne in non-ideal populations with skewed sex ratio or non-random variance in reproductive success. Recent population declines are not likely to seriously affect {\^{}} Ne, but if N has recently increased from a bottleneck {\^{}} Ne can be biased downwards for a few generations. These results should facilitate application of the disequilibrium method for estimating contemporary Ne in natural populations. However, a comprehensive assessment of performance of {\^{}} r2 with highly polymorphic markers such as microsatellites is needed. Introduction},

abstract = {Comparisons of human genomes show that more base pairs are altered as a result of structural variation - including copy number variation - than as a result of point mutations. Here we review advances and challenges in the discovery and genotyping of structural variation. The recent application of massively parallel sequencing methods has complemented microarray-based methods and has led to an exponential increase in the discovery of smaller structural-variation events. Some global discovery biases remain, but the integration of experimental and computational approaches is proving fruitful for accurate characterization of the copy, content and structure of variable regions. We argue that the long-term goal should be routine, cost-effective and high quality de novo assembly of human genomes to comprehensively assess all classes of structural variation.},

Theoret- ical studies show that range expansions are quite different from pure de- mographic expansions and that the extent of recent gene flow conditions expected patterns of molecular diversity within and between populations. Spatially explicit simulation studies have led to unexpected and fascinating results about genetic patterns emerging after a range expansion. For instance, spatial expansions can generate allele frequency gradients, promote the surf- ing of rare variants into newly occupied territories, induce the structuring of newly colonized areas into distinct sectors of low genetic diversity, or lead to massive introgression of local genes into the genome of an invading species. Interestingly, most of these patterns had been previously attributed to distinct selective processes, showing that taking into account the dynamic nature of a species range can lead to a paradigm shift in our perception of evolutionary processes.},

abstract = {Estimation of demographic history from nucleotide sequences represents an important component of many studies in molecular ecology. For example, knowledge of a population's history can allow us to test hypotheses about the impact of climatic and anthropogenic factors. In the past, demographic analysis was typically limited to relatively simple population models, such as exponential or logistic growth. More flexible approaches are now available, including skyline-plot methods that are able to reconstruct changes in population sizes through time. This technical review focuses on these skyline-plot methods. We describe some general principles relating to sampling design and data collection. We then provide an outline of the methodological framework, which is based on coalescent theory, before tracing the development of the various skyline-plot methods and describing their key features. The performance and properties of the methods are illustrated using two simulated data sets.},

The relationship between effective population size (Ne) and the rate of evolution has consequences for our ability to understand and interpret genomic variation, and is central to many aspects of evolution and ecology. Many factors affect the relationship between Ne and the rate of evolution, and recent theoretical and empirical studies have shown some surprising and sometimes counterintuitive results. Some mechanisms tend to make the relationship positive, others negative, and they can act simultaneously. The relationship also depends on whether one is interested in the rate of neutral, adaptive, or deleterious evolution. Here, we synthesize theoretical and empirical approaches to understanding the relationship and highlight areas that remain poorly understood. ?? 2013.},

abstract = {The goal of phylodynamics, an area on the intersection of phylogenetics and population genetics, is to reconstruct population size dynamics from genetic data. Recently, a series of nonparametric Bayesian methods have been proposed for such demographic reconstructions. These methods rely on prior specifications based on Gaussian processes and proceed by approximating the posterior distribution of population size trajectories via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. In this paper, we adapt an integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA), a recently proposed approximate Bayesian inference for latent Gaussian models, to the estimation of population size trajectories. We show that when a genealogy of sampled individuals can be reliably estimated from genetic data, INLA enjoys high accuracy and can replace MCMC entirely. We demonstrate significant computational efficiency over the state-of-the-art MCMC methods. We illustrate INLA-based population size inference using simulations and genealogies of hepatitis C and human influenza viruses.},

@article{Stone2011,
abstract = {How do we quantify patterns (such as responses to local selection) sampled across multiple populations within a single species? Key to this question is the extent to which populations within species represent statistically independent data points in our analysis. Comparative analyses across species and higher taxa have long recognized the need to control for the non-independence of species data that arises through patterns of shared common ancestry among them (phylogenetic non-independence), as have quantitative genetic studies of individuals linked by a pedigree. Analyses across populations lacking pedigree information fall in the middle, and not only have to deal with shared common ancestry, but also the impact of exchange of migrants between populations (gene flow). As a result, phenotypes measured in one population are influenced by processes acting on others, and may not be a good guide to either the strength or direction of local selection. Although many studies examine patterns across populations within species, few consider such non-independence. Here, we discuss the sources of non-independence in comparative analysis, and show why the phylogeny-based approaches widely used in cross-species analyses are unlikely to be useful in analyses across populations within species. We outline the approaches (intraspecific contrasts, generalized least squares, generalized linear mixed models and autoregression) that have been used in this context, and explain their specific assumptions. We highlight the power of 'mixed models' in many contexts where problems of non-independence arise, and show that these allow incorporation of both shared common ancestry and gene flow. We suggest what can be done when ideal solutions are inaccessible, highlight the need for incorporation of a wider range of population models in intraspecific comparative methods and call for simulation studies of the error rates associated with alternative approaches.},

abstract = {Effective population size (Ne ) is a key parameter for monitoring the genetic health of threatened populations because it reflects a population's evolutionary potential and risk of extinction due to genetic stochasticity. However, its application to wildlife monitoring has been limited because it is difficult to measure in natural populations. The isolated and well-studied population of grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem provides a rare opportunity to examine the usefulness of different Ne estimators for monitoring. We genotyped 729 Yellowstone grizzly bears using 20 microsatellites and applied three single-sample estimators to examine contemporary trends in generation interval (GI), effective number of breeders (Nb ) and Ne during 1982-2007. We also used multisample methods to estimate variance (NeV ) and inbreeding Ne (NeI ). Single-sample estimates revealed positive trajectories, with over a fourfold increase in Ne (≈100 to 450) and near doubling of the GI (≈8 to 14) from the 1980s to 2000s. NeV (240-319) and NeI (256) were comparable with the harmonic mean single-sample Ne (213) over the time period. Reanalysing historical data, we found NeV increased from ≈80 in the 1910s-1960s to ≈280 in the contemporary population. The estimated ratio of effective to total census size (Ne /Nc ) was stable and high (0.42-0.66) compared to previous brown bear studies. These results support independent demographic evidence for Yellowstone grizzly bear population growth since the 1980s. They further demonstrate how genetic monitoring of Ne can complement demographic-based monitoring of Nc and vital rates, providing a valuable tool for wildlife managers.},

abstract = {Natural selection and demographic forces can have similar effects on patterns of DNA polymorphism. Therefore, to infer selection from samples of DNA sequences, one must simultaneously account for demographic effects. Here we take a model-based approach to this problem by developing predictions for patterns of polymorphism in the presence of both population size change and natural selection. If data are available from different functional classes of variation, and a priori information suggests that mutations in one of those classes are selectively neutral, then the putatively neutral class can be used to infer demographic parameters, and inferences regarding selection on other classes can be performed given demographic parameter estimates. This procedure is more robust to assumptions regarding the true underlying demography than previous approaches to detecting and analyzing selection. We apply this method to a large polymorphism data set from 301 human genes and find (i) widespread negative selection acting on standing nonsynonymous variation, (ii) that the fitness effects of nonsynonymous mutations are well predicted by several measures of amino acid exchangeability, especially site-specific methods, and (iii) strong evidence for very recent population growth.},

abstract = {Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data can be used for parameter estimation via maximum likelihood methods as long as the way in which the SNPs were determined is known, so that an appropriate likelihood formula can be constructed. We present such likelihoods for several sampling methods. As a test of these approaches, we consider use of SNPs to estimate the parameter Theta = 4N(e)micro (the scaled product of effective population size and per-site mutation rate), which is related to the branch lengths of the reconstructed genealogy. With infinite amounts of data, ML models using SNP data are expected to produce consistent estimates of Theta. With finite amounts of data the estimates are accurate when Theta is high, but tend to be biased upward when Theta is low. If recombination is present and not allowed for in the analysis, the results are additionally biased upward, but this effect can be removed by incorporating recombination into the analysis. SNPs defined as sites that are polymorphic in the actual sample under consideration (sample SNPs) are somewhat more accurate for estimation of Theta than SNPs defined by their polymorphism in a panel chosen from the same population (panel SNPs). Misrepresenting panel SNPs as sample SNPs leads to large errors in the maximum likelihood estimate of Theta. Researchers collecting SNPs should collect and preserve information about the method of ascertainment so that the data can be accurately analyzed.},

abstract = {Estimates of the coalescent effective population size N(e) can be poorly correlated with the true population size. The relationship between N(e) and the population size is sensitive to the way in which birth and death rates vary over time. The problem of inference is exacerbated when the mechanisms underlying population dynamics are complex and depend on many parameters. In instances where nonparametric estimators of N(e) such as the skyline struggle to reproduce the correct demographic history, model-based estimators that can draw on prior information about population size and growth rates may be more efficient. A coalescent model is developed for a large class of populations such that the demographic history is described by a deterministic nonlinear dynamical system of arbitrary dimension. This class of demographic model differs from those typically used in population genetics. Birth and death rates are not fixed, and no assumptions are made regarding the fraction of the population sampled. Furthermore, the population may be structured in such a way that gene copies reproduce both within and across demes. For this large class of models, it is shown how to derive the rate of coalescence, as well as the likelihood of a gene genealogy with heterochronous sampling and labeled taxa, and how to simulate a coalescent tree conditional on a complex demographic history. This theoretical framework encapsulates many of the models used by ecologists and epidemiologists and should facilitate the integration of population genetics with the study of mathematical population dynamics.},

abstract = {To examine the signature of population expansion on genetic variability at microsatellite loci, we consider a population that evolves according to the time-continuous Moran model, with growing population size and mutations that follow a general asymmetric stepwise mutation model. We present calculations of expected allele-size variance and homozygosity at a locus in such a model for several variants of growth, including stepwise, exponential, and logistic growth. These calculations in particular prove that population bottleneck followed by growth in size causes an imbalance between allele size variance and heterozygosity, characterized by the variance being transiently higher than expected under equilibrium conditions. This effect is, in a sense, analogous to that demonstrated before for the infinite allele model, where the number of alleles transiently increases after a stepwise growth of population. We analyze a set of data on tetranucleotide repeats that reveals the imbalance expected under the assumption of bottleneck followed by population growth in two out of three major racial groups. The imbalance is strongest in Asians, intermediate in Europeans, and absent in Africans. This finding is consistent with previous findings by others concerning the population expansion of modern humans, with the bottleneck event being most ancient in Africans, most recent in Asians, and intermediate in Europeans. Nevertheless, the imbalance index alone cannot reliably estimate the time of initiation of population expansion.},

In this contribution, we outline the limitations of classic population genetic data and highlight the potential of combining molecular data with additional environmental, ecological and biological data sets in multidisciplinary approaches. The combination of data sets from various fields allows a more comprehensive understanding of extrinsic and intrinsic evolutionary processes affecting populations such as the distinction between genetic drift and natural selection. The integration of population size estimates and demographic dynamics as well as individual behaviour (embracing aspects like dispersal behaviour) allows for testing of adaptations to local environments and understanding time-lags frequently observed in molecular data. Modelling approaches are integrated at increasing rates into population genetic research to identify potential barriers and corridors.

abstract = {We report here a simulation study examining the effect of a recent spatial expansion on the pattern of molecular diversity within a deme. We first simulate a range expansion in a virtual world consisting in a two-dimensional array of demes exchanging a given proportion of migrants (m) with their neighbors. The recorded demographic and migration histories are then used under a coalescent approach to generate the genetic diversity in a sample of genes. We find that the shape of the gene genealogies and the overall pattern of diversity within demes depend not only on the age of the expansion but also on the level of gene flow between neighboring demes, as measured by the product Nm, where N is the size of a deme. For small Nm values (< approximately 20 migrants sent outwards per generation), a substantial proportion of coalescent events occur early in the genealogy, whereas with larger levels of gene flow, most coalescent events occur around the time of the onset of the spatial expansion. Gene genealogies are star shaped, and mismatch distributions are unimodal after a range expansion for large Nm values. In contrast, gene genealogies present a mixture of both very short and very long branch lengths, and mismatch distributions are multimodal for small Nm values. It follows that statistics used in tests of selective neutrality like Tajima's D statistic or Fu's F(S) statistic will show very significant negative values after a spatial expansion only in demes with high Nm values. In the context of human evolution, this difference could explain very simply the fact that analyses of samples of mitochondrial DNA sequences reveal multimodal mismatch distributions in hunter-gatherers and unimodal distributions in post-Neolithic populations. Indeed, the current simulations show that a recent increase in deme size (resulting in a larger Nm value) is sufficient to prevent recent coalescent events and thus lead to unimodal mismatch distributions, even if deme sizes (and therefore Nm values) were previously much smaller. The fact that molecular diversity within deme is so dependent on recent levels of gene flow suggests that it should be possible to estimate Nm values from samples drawn from a single deme.},

In particular, all assume a single, unstructured population, and none has been evaluated for use with continuously distributed species. We simulated continuous populations with local mating structure, as envisioned by Wright's concept of neighborhood size (NS), and evaluated performance of a single-sample estimator based on linkage disequilibrium (LD), which provides an estimate of the effective number of parents that produced the sample (Nb). Results illustrate the interacting effects of two phenomena, drift and mixture, that contribute to LD. Samples from areas equal to or smaller than a breeding window produced estimates close to the NS. As the sampling window increased in size to encompass multiple genetic neighborhoods, mixture LD from a two-locus Wahlund effect overwhelmed the reduction in drift LD from incorporating offspring from more parents. As a consequence, never approached the global Ne, even when the geographic scale of sampling was large. Results indicate that caution is needed in applying standard methods for estimating effective size to continuously distributed populations.},

abstract = {Effective population size is a fundamental parameter in population genetics, evolutionary biology and conservation biology, yet its estimation can be fraught with difficulties. Several methods to estimate Ne from genetic data have been developed which take advantage of various approaches for inferring Ne . The ability of these methods to accurately estimate Ne , however, has not been comprehensively examined. In this study, we employ seven of the most cited methods for estimating Ne from genetic data (Colony2, CoNe, Estim, MLNe, ONeSAMP, TMVP, and NeEstimator including LDNe) across simulated datasets with populations experiencing migration or no migration. The simulated population demographies are an isolated population with no immigration, an island model metapopulation with a sink population receiving immigrants, and an isolation by distance stepping stone model of populations. We find considerable variance in performance of these methods, both within and across demographic scenarios, with some methods performing very poorly. The most accurate estimates of Ne can be obtained by using LDNe, MLNe, or TMVP; however each of these approaches is outperformed by another in a differing demographic scenario. Knowledge of the approximate demography of population as well as the availability of temporal data largely improves Ne estimates. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Changes in population size influence genetic diversity of the population and, as a result, leave a signature of these changes in individual genomes in the population. We are interested in the inverse problem of reconstructing past population dynamics from genomic data. We start with a standard framework based on the coalescent, a stochastic process that generates genealogies connecting randomly sampled individuals from the population of interest. These genealogies serve as a glue between the population demographic history and genomic sequences. It turns out that only the times of genealogical lineage coalescences contain information about population size dynamics. Viewing these coalescent times as a point process, estimating population size trajectories is equivalent to estimating a conditional intensity of this point process. Therefore, our inverse problem is similar to estimating an inhomogeneous Poisson process intensity function. We demonstrate how recent advances in Gaussian process-based nonparametric inference for Poisson processes can be extended to Bayesian nonparametric estimation of population size dynamics under the coalescent. We compare our Gaussian process (GP) approach to one of the state-of-the-art Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) methods for estimating population trajectories. Using simulated data, we demonstrate that our method has better accuracy and precision. Next, we analyze two genealogies reconstructed from real sequences of hepatitis C and human Influenza A viruses. In both cases, we recover more believed aspects of the viral demographic histories than the GMRF approach. We also find that our GP method produces more reasonable uncertainty estimates than the GMRF method.},

abstract = {In a 1997 seminal paper, W. Maddison proposed minimizing deep coalescences, or MDC, as an optimization criterion for inferring the species tree from a set of incongruent gene trees, assuming the incongruence is exclusively due to lineage sorting. In a subsequent paper, Maddison and Knowles provided and implemented a search heuristic for optimizing the MDC criterion, given a set of gene trees. However, the heuristic is not guaranteed to compute optimal solutions, and its hill-climbing search makes it slow in practice. In this paper, we provide two exact solutions to the problem of inferring the species tree from a set of gene trees under the MDC criterion. In other words, our solutions are guaranteed to find the tree that minimizes the total number of deep coalescences from a set of gene trees. One solution is based on a novel integer linear programming (ILP) formulation, and another is based on a simple dynamic programming (DP) approach. Powerful ILP solvers, such as CPLEX, make the first solution appealing, particularly for very large-scale instances of the problem, whereas the DP-based solution eliminates dependence on proprietary tools, and its simplicity makes it easy to integrate with other genomic events that may cause gene tree incongruence. Using the exact solutions, we analyze a data set of 106 loci from eight yeast species, a data set of 268 loci from eight Apicomplexan species, and several simulated data sets. We show that the MDC criterion provides very accurate estimates of the species tree topologies, and that our solutions are very fast, thus allowing for the accurate analysis of genome-scale data sets. Further, the efficiency of the solutions allow for quick exploration of sub-optimal solutions, which is important for a parsimony-based criterion such as MDC, as we show. We show that searching for the species tree in the compatibility graph of the clusters induced by the gene trees may be sufficient in practice, a finding that helps ameliorate the computational requirements of optimization solutions. Further, we study the statistical consistency and convergence rate of the MDC criterion, as well as its optimality in inferring the species tree. Finally, we show how our solutions can be used to identify potential horizontal gene transfer events that may have caused some of the incongruence in the data, thus augmenting Maddison's original framework. We have implemented our solutions in the PhyloNet software package, which is freely available at: http://bioinfo.cs.rice.edu/phylonet.},

Deciphering the genetic consequences of past climatic change is also critical for the conservation and sustainable management of forest and tree genetic resources, a timely endeavour as the Earth heads into a period of fast climate change. We used a combination of genetic data and ecological niche models to investigate the historical patterns of biogeographic range expansion of a wild fruit tree, the European crabapple (Malus sylvestris), a wild contributor to the domesticated apple. Both climatic predictions for the last glacial maximum and analyses of microsatellite variation indicated that M. sylvestris experienced range contraction and fragmentation. Bayesian clustering analyses revealed a clear pattern of genetic structure, with one genetic cluster spanning a large area in Western Europe and two other genetic clusters with a more limited distribution range in Eastern Europe, one around the Carpathian Mountains and the other restricted to the Balkan Peninsula. Approximate Bayesian computation appeared to be a powerful technique for inferring the history of these clusters, supporting a scenario of simultaneous differentiation of three separate glacial refugia. Admixture between these three populations was found in their suture zones. A weak isolation by distance pattern was detected within each population, indicating a high extent of historical gene flow for the European crabapple.},

At the core of many of these approaches is the extraction of information from the structure of phylogenetic trees to infer the demographic history of a population, and underlying nearly all methods is coalescent theory.

abstract = {The recent development of methods that apply coalescent theory to phylogenetic problems has enabled the study of the population-level phenomena that drove the diversification of anthropoid primates. Effective population size, Ne, is one of the main parameters that constitute the theoretical underpinning of these new analytical approaches. For this reason, the ancestral N(e) of selected primate lineages has been thoroughly investigated. However, for some of these lineages, the estimates of ancestral N(e) reported in several studies present significant variation. This is the case for the common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees. Moreover, several ancestral anthropoid lineages have been ignored in the studies conducted so far. Because N(e) is fundamental to understand historic species demography, it is a crucial component of a complete description of the historical scenario of primate evolution. It also provides information that is helpful for differentiating between competing biogeographical hypotheses. In this study, the effective population sizes of the anthropoid ancestors of the human-chimp lineage are inferred using data sets of coding and noncoding sequences. A general pattern of a serial decline of population sizes is found between the ancestral lineage of Anthropoidea and that of Homo and Pan. When the theoretical distribution of gene trees was derived from the parametric estimates obtained, it closely corresponded to the empirical frequency of inferred gene trees along the genome. The most abrupt decrease of N(e) was found between the ancestors of all great apes and those of the African great apes alone. This suggests the occurrence of a genetic bottleneck during the evolution of Homininae, which corroborates the origin of African apes from a Eurasian ancestor.},

Using simulations, we show that $\psi$ is more powerful for detecting range expansions than both FST and clines in heterozygosity.

A framework for estimating the essential parameter theta = 4Nu utilizing the frequencies of mutations of various sizes and types is developed in this paper, where N is the effective size of a population and mu is mutation rate per sequence per generation. The framework is a combination of coalescent theory, general linear model and Monte-Carlo integration, which leads to two new estimators theta xi and theta eta as well as a general Watterson's estimator theta K and a general Tajima's estimator theta tau. The greatest strength of the framework is that it can be used under a variety of population models. The properties of the framework and the four estimators theta K, theta tau, theta xi and theta eta are investigated under three important population models: the neutral Wright-Fisher model, the neutral model with recombination and the neutral Wright's finite-islands model. Under all these models, it is shown that theta xi is the best estimator among the four even when recombination rate or migration rate has to be estimated. Under the neutral Wright-Fisher model, it is shown that the new estimator theta xi has a variance close to a lower bound of variances of all unbiased estimators of theta which suggests that theta xi is a very efficient estimator.},

@article{Gaggiotti2011,
abstract = {Understanding speciation is a fundamental aim of evolutionary biology and a very challenging one. Speciation can be viewed as the dynamics of genetic differentiation between populations resulting in substantial reproductive isolation (Gavrilets 2003). It was generally accepted that very small levels of migration prevent genetic differentiation among populations and, therefore, speciation. However, recent theoretical work showed that sympatric speciation is possible (Gavrilets 2003). Nevertheless, providing empirical evidence that gene flow occurred during speciation is challenging because several gene flow scenarios can explain observed patterns of genetic differentiation. Positive migration rate estimates alone do not prove ongoing gene flow during divergence. We also need to know whether migration took place before, during or after speciation. There is no statistical method specifically aimed at estimating gene flow timing, but several studies used the isolation with migration model (Hey {\&} Nielsen 2004, 2007; Hey 2010b) to estimate this parameter and make inferences about speciation scenarios. It is tempting to use statistical methods to estimate important evolutionary parameters even if they do not appear explicitly in the inference model. Nevertheless, before doing so, we need to determine whether they can provide reliable results. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Strasburg and Rieseberg (2011) present a simulation study that examines the degree to which gene flow timing estimates obtained from IMa2 (Hey 2010b) can be used to make inferences about speciation mode. Their results are sobering; gene flow timing estimates obtained in this way are not reliable and cannot be used to unequivocally establish if gene flow was ongoing during speciation.},

We verify a previous proposal by Felsenstein that weighting individuals by reproductive value is the correct way to calculate parametric population allele frequencies, in which case the rate of change in age-structured populations conforms to that predicted by discrete-generation models. When the standard temporal method is applied to age-structured species, typical sampling regimes (sampling only newborns or adults; randomly sampling the entire population) do not yield properly weighted allele frequencies and result in biased [IMG]f1.gif" ALT="Formula" BORDER="0">. The direction and magnitude of the bias are shown to depend on the sampling method and the species' life history. Results for populations that grow (or decline) at a constant rate paralleled those for populations of constant size. If sufficient demographic data are available and certain sampling restrictions are met, the Jorde-Ryman modification of the temporal method can be applied to any species with overlapping generations. Alternatively, spacing the temporal samples many generations apart maximizes the drift signal compared to sampling biases associated with age structure},

Recent developments allow wildlife researchers to obtain genetic material via non-invasive sampling techniques that may provide the large sample sizes necessary for precise estimates of N-e and N-c. Population genetic theory provides several methods to estimate N-e from allele frequency data: including temporal change in allele frequencies, gametic disequilibrium and heterozygote excess methods. Modification of capture-mark-recapture methods for use with multi-locus genotype data provides new means for estimating N-c. The combination of new DNA sampling techniques, polymerase chain reaction-based DNA markers and analytical methods may provide unprecedented power to detect reductions in N-e and N-c of endangered populations. However, these genetic methods are largely untested in the field. We review some relatively unexplored, but promising ways that multi-locus genetic data can be used to provide important genetic and demographic information and suggest avenues for further research in this area.},

abstract = {Determining what factors affect the structuring of genetic variation is key to deciphering the relative roles of different evolutionary processes in species differentiation. Such information is especially critical to understanding how the frequent shifts and fragmentation of species distributions during the Pleistocene translates into species differences, and why the effect of such rapid climate change on patterns of species diversity varies among taxa. Studies of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have detected significant population structure in many species, including those directly impacted by the glacial cycles. Yet, understanding the ultimate consequence of such structure, as it relates to how species divergence occurs, requires demonstration that such patterns are also shared with genomic patterns of differentiation. Here we present analyses of amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) in the montane grasshopper Melanoplus oregonensis to assess the evolutionary significance of past demographic events and associated drift-induced divergence as inferred from mtDNA. As an inhabitant of the sky islands of the northern Rocky Mountains, this species was subject to repeated and frequent shifts in species distribution in response to the many glacial cycles. Nevertheless, significant genetic structuring of M. oregonensis is evident at two different geographic and temporal scales: recent divergence associated with the recolonization of the montane meadows in individual sky islands, as well as older divergence associated with displacements into regional glacial refugia. The genomic analyses indicate that drift-induced divergence, despite the lack of long-standing geographic barriers, has significantly contributed to species divergence during the Pleistocene. Moreover, the finding that divergence associated with past demographic events involves the repartitioning of ancestral variation without significant reductions of genomic diversity has intriguing implications - namely, the further amplification of drift-induced divergence by selection.},

abstract = {The rate of nucleotide substitution is generally believed to be a decreasing function of effective population size, at least for nonsynonymous substitutions. This view was originally based on consideration of slightly deleterious mutations with a fixed distribution of selection coefficients. A realistic model must include the occurrence and fixation of some advantageous mutations that compensate for the loss of fitness due to deleterious substitutions. Some such models, such as so-called "fixed" models, also predict a population size effect on substitution rate. An alternative model, presented here, predicts the near absence of a population size effect on substitution rate. This model is based on concave log-fitness functions and a fixed distribution of mutational effects on the selectively important trait. Simulations of an instance of the model confirm the approximate insensitivity of the substitution rate to population size. Although much experimental evidence has been claimed to support the existence of a population size effect, the body of evidence as a whole is equivocal, and much of the evidence that is supposed to demonstrate such an effect would also suggest that it is very small. Perhaps the proposed model applies well to some genes and not so well to others, and genes therefore vary with regard to the population size effect.},

Results of this study are as follows: (1) Low-frequency alleles upwardly bias {\^{}}Ne, but a simple rule can reduce bias to <about 10{\%} without sacrificing much precision. (2) With datasets routinely available today (10–20 loci with 10 alleles; 50 individuals), precise estimates can be obtained for relatively small populations (Ne < 200), and small populations are not likely to be mistaken for large ones. However, it is very difficult to obtain reliable estimates for large populations. (3) With ‘microsatellite’ data, the LD method has greater precision than the temporal method, unless the latter is based on samples taken many generations apart. Our results indicate the LD method has widespread applicability to conservation (which typically focuses on small populations) and the study of evolutionary processes in local populations. Considerable opportunity exists to extract more information about Ne in nature by wider use of single-sample estimators and by combining estimates from different methods.},

abstract = {Mapping adaptive trait loci (ATL) underlying ecological divergence is an essential step towards understanding the processes that generate phenotypic diversity. Technological advances have made it possible to sequence exomes in nonmodel systems, providing an efficient means of analysing functional genetic variants. Divergence scans of genetic markers for outlier loci, or 'divergence mapping', have been used to map locally adapted genes, but this approach is likely to be underpowered when background divergence is elevated. Genotype-phenotype association tests in admixed populations, or 'admixture mapping', may provide a useful approach for mapping locally adapted loci when neutral divergence is high. To determine the power and limits of divergence mapping, we simulated exomes containing a single ATL across two parental populations of varying neutral divergence, estimated divergence and quantified the power to identify the ATL. We found that divergence mapping had very high power when background FST is <0.2, but decreased dramatically above this level. To evaluate the utility of admixture mapping, we simulated exomes from admixed populations, then simulated phenotypes, conducted genotype-phenotype association tests and found that even two generations of random mating after admixture could provide high mapping power in scenarios where pure divergence mapping was ineffective (FST = 0.35). Moreover, admixture mapping had high power across all levels of divergence after 20 generations since admixture. Together with high-throughput exome sequencing, admixture mapping could be used to map ATL in systems such as Heliconius butterflies or Gryllus crickets when experimental design and analytical approach are chosen accordingly.},

abstract = {The history of human population size is important for understanding human evolution. Various studies have found evidence for a founder event (bottleneck) in East Asian and European populations, associated with the human dispersal out-of-Africa event around 60 thousand years (kyr) ago. However, these studies have had to assume simplified demographic models with few parameters, and they do not provide a precise date for the start and stop times of the bottleneck. Here, with fewer assumptions on population size changes, we present a more detailed history of human population sizes between approximately ten thousand and a million years ago, using the pairwise sequentially Markovian coalescent model applied to the complete diploid genome sequences of a Chinese male (YH), a Korean male (SJK), three European individuals (J. C. Venter, NA12891 and NA12878 (ref. 9)) and two Yoruba males (NA18507 (ref. 10) and NA19239). We infer that European and Chinese populations had very similar population-size histories before 10-20 kyr ago. Both populations experienced a severe bottleneck 10-60 kyr ago, whereas African populations experienced a milder bottleneck from which they recovered earlier. All three populations have an elevated effective population size between 60 and 250 kyr ago, possibly due to population substructure. We also infer that the differentiation of genetically modern humans may have started as early as 100-120 kyr ago, but considerable genetic exchanges may still have occurred until 20-40 kyr ago.},

Strong levels of purifying selection found in all the populations together with neutrality tests conforming to neutral expectations agree with large effective population sizes. Assignment tests reported a clear distinction between Scandinavian and Scottish grouse suggesting the existence of two different evolutionary significant units.

Expressions are derived for their variance in the presence of intragenic recombination for a panmictic population of fixed size that is at neutral equilibrium at the region sequenced. We show that, in contrast to the slow decrease in variance with increasing sample size, if the recombination rate is nonzero, the asymptotic rate of decrease of variance with increasing sequence length, for fixed sample size, is quite rapid. In particular, it is close to that which would be obtained by sequencing independent chromosome regions. The correlation between measures of diversity from linked regions is also examined. For a given total number of bases sequenced in a particular region, optimal sequencing strategies are derived. These typically involve sequencing relatively few (three to 10) long copies of the region. Under optimal strategies, the variances of the two measures are very similar for most parameter values considered. Results concerning optimal sequencing strategies will be sensitive to gross departures from the underlying assumptions, such as population bottlenecks, selective sweeps, and substantial population substructure.},

For a given locus, using both recursive and nonrecursive approaches, we compute the probability distribution of the number of genetic founding lineages that have given rise to the derived population. This number of genetic founding lineages is defined as the number of ancestral individuals that contributed at the locus to the present-day derived population, and is formulated in terms of interspecific coalescence events. The effects of sample size and divergence time on the probability distribution of the number of founding lineages are studied in detail. For 99.99{\%} of the loci in the derived population to each have one founding lineage, the two populations must be separated for ??? 9.9 N generations. However, only ??? 0.87 N generations must pass since divergence for 99.99{\%} of the loci to have < 6 founding lineages.

abstract = {Genetic stochasticity due to small population size contributes to population extinction, especially when population fragmentation disrupts gene flow. Estimates of effective population size (Ne) can therefore be informative about population persistence, but there is a need for an assessment of their consistency and informative relevance. Here we review the body of empirical estimates of Ne for wild populations obtained with the temporal genetic method and published since Frankham's (1995) review. Theoretical considerations have identified important sources of bias for this analytical approach, and we use empirical data to investigate the extent of these biases. We find that particularly model selection and sampling require more attention in future studies. We report a median unbiased Ne estimate of 260 (among 83 studies) and find that this median estimate tends to be smaller for populations of conservation concern, which may therefore be more sensitive to genetic stochasticity. Furthermore, we report a median Ne/N ratio of 0.14, and find that this ratio may actually be higher for small populations, suggesting changes in biological interactions at low population abundances. We confirm the role of gene flow in countering genetic stochasticity by finding that Ne correlates strongest with neutral genetic metrics when populations can be considered isolated. This underlines the importance of gene flow for the estimation of Ne, and of population connectivity for conservation in general. Reductions in contemporary gene flow due to ongoing habitat fragmentation will likely increase the prevalence of genetic stochasticity, which should therefore remain a focal point in the conservation of biodiversity.},
